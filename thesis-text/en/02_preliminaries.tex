\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{preliminaries}

In this section we briefly introduce and explain the necessary theoretical background, upon which we build later on.

We first define the concepts of Machine learning (ML) and Deep neural networks (DNNs). We explain, how DNNs can learn patterns from data by using powerful gradient-based stochastic optimization algorithm called Stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Then we talk about a subset of DNNs that perform very well on image data called Convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Finally, we describe the systemic vulnerability of DNNs and we define and explain adversarial attacks and defenses, adversarial examples, adversarial robustness and different adversarial attack threat models.
