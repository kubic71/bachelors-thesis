\def\Abstract{

The goal of this thesis is to explore the vulnerability of deep neural image classifiers in a realistic scenario. Several augmentation operations have been explored and a combination of suitable white box and black box methods have been proposed. As a result, we have implemented a system that successfully attacks the Google Cloud Vision API.
