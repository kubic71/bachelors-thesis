\section{Blackbox PoC}
Here we go into more technical details about previously mentioned blackbox attacks we initially tried.

\begin{itemize}
    \item TREMBA
    \item RayS
    \item SquareAttack
    \item Sparse-RS
\end{itemize}

\subsection{TREMBA}

\subsection{RayS}
This one is hard label attack and doesn't use the continuos loss from GVision.

\subsection{SquareAttack}

\subsubsection{SquareAttack L2}
Show an image of nice cat.

\subsubsection{SquareAttack Linf}

\subsubsection{Comparison with local success-rate}



\section{Local transferability experiments}
Here go all the different transfer-matrices

\subsection{Choice of dataset}

\subsection{Choice of classifies}

\subsection{Baseline}

\section{Transferability evaluation on GVision}
TODO: just run the images against GVision

\subsection{Choice of evaluation metrics}
